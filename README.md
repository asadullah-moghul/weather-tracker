Project Name: Weather Tracker App 
Background Information: I’ve always loved roadtrips, especially the planning. As a kid I was always the navigator, keeping track of highway interchanges, the next stop for gas, and any interesting bits of information I could glean from the map or roadside signs. 

Problem: The weather! The one thing that the maps and roadside signs don’t tell you is the weather forecast, and while that doesn’t seem like a big deal I’ve found that there are times when it would have been really useful: 
Driving long distances, over multiple days
Driving through areas that are prone to rapidly changing conditions

Deliverables: 
- Weather forecasted along your travel route, for your planned time of travel
- single forecast generated when route/time info is entered
- Real time updates of forecasts while traveling
- Save “favorite” routes for frequent travel
- Ability for app to use GPS data and track route as well as the weather
